  description: Ecosystems are typically composed by a large number of interacting individuals
        and species. What do determine their stability respect to perturbation
        and their persistence in time?
        The first lesson of statistical physics is that we cannot use the same methods that
        we use to study the motion of two bodies to describe a tank of gas. Following
        a long tradition in theoretical ecology, we study stability and persistence
        of ecosystems using random matrices. This approach allows to identify what are
        the relevant quantities that determine the fate of those systems.
        In particular we were able to find a stability condition for empirical
        food-webs
        [<a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8842">NC2015a</a>]
        and to characterize how perturbations spread across species
        [<a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10179">NC2015b</a>].
        We also studied the persistence of a population in a fragmented landscape using random matrix techniques

  with: "M. Cosentino Lagomarsino, S. Maslov"
  description: Life populates almost every corner of this planet, with striking differences
        of forms and shapes, that reflect the adaptation to a particular environment and
        unique evolutionary histories. Despite the contingency of the processes shaping genomes, remarkable
        regularities and patterns can be found across organisms.
        We studied how different patterns involving genes with the same
        functions were connected to patterns of evolutionary closely related genes
        [<a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr7112">NAR2012</a>].
        We also studied the role of HGT in shaping the genomes of prokaryotes and
        the relation between genes occurrence and HGT

- title: "Neutral theory and spatial ecology"
  with: "S. Azaele, J.R. Banavar, A. Maritan"
  description: Macroscopic phenomena are intrinsically stochastic and noise strongly affects
        the species composition and diversity of ecosystems. Statistical mechanics
        offers many tools that
        can be applied to study these systems
        [<a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/RevModPhys.88.035003">RMP2016</a>].
        We showed how spatial dispersal of species makes ecosystems inevitably out of equilibrium
        [<a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075/100/38002">EPL2012</a>]. While this
        fact makes simple models analytically untractable, there is still room
        for analytical solutions in spatially explicit systems. Using a phenomenological
        model we were able to connect different spatial and non-spatial ecological patterns

- title: "Cell-size control in bacteria"
  with: "M. Cosentino Lagomarsino, M. Osella"
  description: The dream of every cell is to become two cells. Without a coupling between cell size and
        division, cells would not have the experimentally observed stationary distribution of sizes.
        Thanks to the availability of high-throughput data, it has become possible to study cell-size
        control quantitatively, and many models have been proposed to describe it.
        We showed that many empirical observations can be explained using scaling arguments,
        without the need of invoking specific mechanisms
        [<a target="_blank" href="http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.93.012408">PRE2016</a>].
        Scaling allows, in fact, to connect
        apparently unrelated measurable quantities in a parameter-free setting. On the other hand,
        we characterized the class of models compatible with scaling, isolating few parameters that
        describe cell-size control across species and conditions
        [<a target="_blank" href="http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.95.032411">PRE2017</a>].


- title: "Paths to criticality without fine-tuning"
  with: "J.R. Banavar, J. Hidalgo, A. Maritan, M. Muñoz, S. Suweis"
  description: Scale-free phenomena are quite common in biological and social systems.
        In condensed matter physics long range correlations emerges by fine-tuning
        the parameters to a critical point. Whether these observations are truly
        signatures of criticality is still an open problem and
        we are trying to find ways to identify
        in an unbiased way criticality in empirical data.
        We proposed a general
        framework, based on information theory and amenable of analytical treatment

        how criticality can emerge without fine-tuning but as a consequence of
        evolution and adaptation
